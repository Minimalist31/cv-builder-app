          Iâ€™m Saumya Sarangi, but you can just call me Saumya. Originally
          hailing from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ for the last decade or so Iâ€™ve been honing my
          skills in design, production and management roles building products
          for the web, mobile, games and, more recently, VR & AR. I strive to
          create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while
          keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation,
          scalability and developer sanity. Iâ€™ve worked with small, agile teams
          on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product
          lifecycles spanning multiple years. Depending on the team, resources
          and deliverables Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the years - holding titles
          like Product Designer, UI Designer, UX Designer, Front-end Developer,
          Growth Lead, Producer, Product Manager & Product Owner. I also
          occasionally give talks on design and product development. Have an
          interesting project?{" "}
